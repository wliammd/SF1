###CHAPTER: Stains (IHC and Special) and Molecular Markers

###SECTION: Stains and Molecular Markers by Subspecialty = Pituitary stains

###STAIN: SF-1

###Definition/general:
* Member of the steroid receptor superfamily of genes; encodes a transcription factor that regulates cytochrome P450 genes (CYP11A and CYP11B)
* Found in anterior pituitary cells containing gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), but not in other adenohypophyseal cell types (ref).
* Gonadotroph adenomas comprise the largest category of pituitary adenomas

###Essential features:
*	Strong nuclear staining is observed within gonadotrophs, pituitary adenomas that develop along this line of differentiation and in other (non-pituitary) tumors that express SF-1.

###Terminology:
*	Pituitary adenoma = “pituitary neuroendocrine tumor”  (PitNET) in 2017 proposal (ref Asa 2017)

###Pathophysiology:
*	Pituitary adenomas reflect anterior pituitary development
*	And as follows

###Clinical features: 
*	Clinical features are as follows
*	And as follows

###Uses for Pathologists:
*	Useful for diagnosis of gonadotroph adenomas (1, 2). 
*	More sensitive than antibodies to LH and FSH (ref. 
*	Also present within normal anterior pituitary gland, so the presence of pituitary adenoma must be confirmed on H&E stains (occasionally with the support of ancillary stains such as reticulin stains for normal adenohypophyseal architecture). 
*	Also a sensitive marker of sex cord stromal tumors of the ovary (3-5), and can be used to distinguish these tumors from other types of ovarian tumor.

###Prognostic Factors:
*	Adenoma type is considered a prognostic factor
*
